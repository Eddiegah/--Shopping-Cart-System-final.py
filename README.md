Ghana Shopping Cart System
Overview
The Ghana Shopping Cart System is a Python-based command-line application designed to simulate a shopping experience tailored for the Ghanaian market. This project demonstrates a robust, user-friendly system with a focus on functionality, aesthetics, and real-world applicability. It allows users to browse a categorized product catalog, manage a shopping cart, apply discounts, and generate detailed invoices, all presented in a visually appealing, color-coded terminal interface.
Project Highlights

Comprehensive Product Catalog: Features over 30 products across six categories (Fruits, Drinks, Dairy & Breakfast, Meats & Seafood, Staples & Cooking, Household) with prices in Ghana Cedis (GHS).
Advanced Cart Management: Supports adding, updating, and removing items with intuitive input validation to prevent errors.
Discount Logic: Implements "Buy N Get 1 Free" discounts for selected products (e.g., Apples, Bananas, Milk, Soap), showcasing real-world retail logic.
Polished Interface: Uses ANSI color codes for a vibrant, organized terminal display, enhancing user experience and presentation quality.
Error Handling: Robust input validation ensures the system handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-existent products, negative quantities).
Structured Code: Modular design with clear function separation for readability, maintainability, and extensibility.

Features

ðŸ“¦ Categorized Catalog: Products are grouped into intuitive categories for easy browsing.
ðŸ›’ Cart Operations: Add, view, update, or remove items with clear feedback.
ðŸ’° Dynamic Discounts: Automatically applies discounts during invoice generation for eligible products.
ðŸ“ƒ Detailed Invoice: Generates a formatted invoice with subtotals, discounts, and a final total.
ðŸŽ¨ Color-Coded Output: Enhances readability with distinct colors for headers, categories, and statuses.
âœ… Input Validation: Prevents errors with case-insensitive product searches and numeric quantity checks.

File Structure

shopping_cart_system.py: Core script containing all logic, including catalog, cart management, and invoice generation.
README.md: This file, providing setup instructions and project details.

Future Improvements

GUI Integration: Add a graphical interface using Tkinter or a web framework like Flask for broader accessibility.
Database Support: Store products and user data in a database for scalability.
Additional Discounts: Introduce percentage-based discounts or bundle offers.
User Accounts: Implement user profiles for personalized shopping experiences.
Export Invoices: Allow users to save invoices as PDF or text files.

Notes

The product catalog and discount rules are hardcoded in catalog and discounts dictionaries for simplicity but can be extended or externalized (e.g., to a JSON file).
ANSI color codes enhance the terminal experience; ensure your terminal supports them (e.g., Windows Terminal, Linux terminals, or macOS Terminal).
The system is designed for ease of use and clarity, making it ideal for educational projects and demonstrations.
